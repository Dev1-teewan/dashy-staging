## Your Intuitive Wallet Cluster Management Tool

Dashy is designed to help you manage multiple crypto wallets by grouping them into clusters based on their purpose. Whether for trading, storage, or specific transactions, Dashy keeps your portfolio organized while ensuring privacy and isolation between wallet groups.

## Why Dashy?

Managing numerous crypto wallets across browser extensions can be chaotic. With Dashy, you can group your wallets into isolated clusters, avoiding the risk of intermixing funds or unintentionally exposing your entire holdings. Keep track of wallet interactions in one seamless, intuitive interface.

## Key Features

- **Create and Manage Clusters**: Easily organize your wallets into clusters with custom tags and purposes.

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Effortlessly move wallets between clusters for quick organization.

- **Export and Import Settings**: Seamlessly transfer your configuration between browsers using JSON export/import.
- **Transaction History and Token Balances**: View complete transaction history and wallet balances across all clusters.
